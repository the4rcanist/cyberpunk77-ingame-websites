        <p>What IS Night Corporation? Richard Night's legacy. 
            <br>
            The foundation stone of Night City. It's silent, watchful guardian.</p>

        <div id="description2">
            <p>Here are three things Night Corporation is not:
            A manufacturer of junk. A company that only cares about profit. A foreign imposter on American soil.
            </p>
            <img src="images/500x10.png">
            <p>We grew out of the Richard Night foundation - a man who dreamt of creating the perfect city. Keeping Richard Night's dream alive is what underlies all of our projects, investments and public efforts, such as the udnerground Maglev tunnels. We finance research and donate to orphanages, and by adhering to our founder's vision, we improve the living standards of all Night Citizens like nobody else can.
            We're not afraid of rist. Nothing comes before Night City.</p>
