    <p>The greatest band of all time was formed at the start of the 21st century in Night City. Its members included:
        <ul>
            <li>Johnny Silverhand - the lord of punk, anti-establishment warrior, ex-soldier and arch-nemesis of corporations. Vocals/guitar.</li>
            <li>Kerry Eurodyne - a pal of Johnny's who sang almost just as good, but without that extra edge. He went mainstream after the band split up. Vocals/guitar.</li>
            <li>Denny - a tough-as-nails chick who beat the shit out of those drums. Drums.</li>
            <li>Nancy (currently known as Bes Isis) - a virtuoso on the keys. Apparently she threw her abusive husband out of a megablock window. Too bad she said out to N54 News. Keyboard.</li>
            <li>Henry - a do-it-all whiz kid. Worked on the first personal link prototype.</li>
        </ul>

    <p class="desc1">Samurai started out by playing in a small, smoke-filled club called the Rainbow Cadenza. I'll never forget the vibe. Dust-ups with corpos, drinking contests with Nance, listening to Johnny's hour-long tirades...not to mention his sense of humor. One time he printed shirts for a 2020 worldwide concert tour - It's funny because Samurai couldn't even get an arena gig in the states. He picked some really random places...Beijing, Sapporo, Katowice. Happen to have one of the shirts myself. Too bad no one got the jokoe.
    Real rock with a capital R died the way of Silverhand - with a flash and tower-crumbling bang.
    We're still here listening to your songs, Johnny. And we remember. There's nothing  left for us.</p>
